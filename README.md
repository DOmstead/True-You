# True You 

There comes a time in all our lives where we question

## Is this really who I am?

Sometimes, the answer we find inside ourselves raises a need.

A need for change.

Sometimes a small change. Sometimes a large change.

## Sometimes that change means finding a new name

# True You. Find yourself. Find Your Name.

True You is a fullstack app that utilizes Javascript, React, Express, Node, HTML5, CSS3, and PostgreSQL to create a unique user experience. It allows users to input some basic criteria, and then be provided with names that meet that criteria from a database of over 2000+ of the most popular names from the last century. This can help users find a name that matches their true self, and then provides them with some insight into how they might test seeing if this name is right for them. 

This Git is for the frontend portion of the application. A link to the live app and the backend portion of this app can be found below.
